    "until now, we simplified all of our numerical examples\n",

    "When the input data contains multiple channels,\n",

    "so that it can perform cross-correlation with the input data.\n",
    "Assuming that the number of channels for the input data is $c_i$,\n",
    "the number of input channels of the convolution kernel also needs to be $c_i$. If our convolution kernel's window shape is $k_h\\times k_w$,\n",
    "then when $c_i=1$, we can think of our convolution kernel\n",
    "as just a two-dimensional array of shape $k_h\\times k_w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when $c_i>1$, we need a kernel\n",
    "that contains an array of shape $k_h\\times k_w$ *for each input channel*. Concatenating these $c_i$ arrays together\n",
    "yields a convolution kernel of shape $c_i\\times k_h\\times k_w$.\n",
    "Since the input and convolution kernel each have $c_i$ channels,\n",
    "we can perform a cross-correlation operation\n",
    "on the two-dimensional array of the input\n",
    "and the two-dimensional kernel array of the convolution kernel\n",
    "for each channel, adding the $c_i$ results together\n",
    "(summing over the channels)\n",
    "to yield a two-dimensional array.\n",
    "This is the result of a two-dimensional cross-correlation\n",
