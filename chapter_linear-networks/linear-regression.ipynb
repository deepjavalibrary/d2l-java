    "Regression refers to a set of methods for modeling\n",
    "the relationship between data points $\\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "and corresponding real-valued targets $y$.\n",
    "In the natural sciences and social sciences,\n",
    "the purpose of regression is most often to\n",
    "*characterize* the relationship between the inputs and outputs.\n",
    "Machine learning, on the other hand,\n",
    "is most often concerned with *prediction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression problems pop up whenever we want to predict a numerical value.\n",
    "Common examples include predicting prices (of homes, stocks, etc.),\n",
    "predicting length of stay (for patients in the hospital),\n",
    "demand forecasting (for retail sales), among countless others.\n",

    "## Basic Elements of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "*Linear regression* may be both the simplest\n",
    "and most popular among the standard tools to regression.\n",
    "Dating back to the dawn of the 19th century,\n",
    "linear regression flows from a few simple assumptions.\n",
    "First, we assume that the relationship between\n",
    "the *features* $\\mathbf{x}$ and targets $y$ is linear,\n",
    "i.e., that $y$ can be expressed as a weighted sum\n",
    "of the inputs $\\textbf{x}$,\n",
    "give or take some noise on the observations.\n",
    "Second, we assume that any noise is well-behaved\n",
    "(following a Gaussian distribution).\n",
    "To motivate the approach, let us start with a running example.\n",
    "Suppose that we wish to estimate the prices of houses (in dollars)\n",
    "based on their area (in square feet) and age (in years).\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually fit a model for predicting house prices,\n",
    "we would need to get our hands on a dataset\n",
    "consisting of sales for which we know\n",
    "the sale price, area and age for each home.\n",
    "In the terminology of machine learning,\n",
    "the dataset is called a *training data set* or *training set*,\n",
    "and each row (here the data corresponding to one sale)\n",
    "is called an *example* (or *data instance*, \"data point\", *sample*).\n",
    "The thing we are trying to predict (here, the price)\n",
    "is called a *label* (or *target*).\n",
    "The variables (here *age* and *area*)\n",
    "upon which the predictions are based\n",
    "are called *features* or *covariates*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, we will use $n$ to denote\n",
    "the number of examples in our dataset.\n",
    "We index the data instances by $i$, denoting each input\n",
    "as $x^{(i)} = [x_1^{(i)}, x_2^{(i)}]$\n",
    "and the corresponding label as $y^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The linearity assumption just says that the target (price)\n",
    "can be expressed as a weighted sum of the features (area and age):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{price} = w_{\\mathrm{area}} \\cdot \\mathrm{area} + w_{\\mathrm{age}} \\cdot \\mathrm{age} + b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $w_{\\mathrm{area}}$ and $w_{\\mathrm{age}}$\n",
    "are called *weights*, and $b$ is called a *bias*\n",
    "(also called an *offset* or *intercept*).\n",
    "The weights determine the influence of each feature\n",
    "on our prediction and the bias just says\n",
    "what value the predicted price should take\n",
    "when all of the features take value $0$.\n",
    "Even if we will never see any homes with zero area,\n",
    "or that are precisely zero years old,\n",
    "we still need the intercept or else we will\n",
    "limit the expressivity of our linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset, our goal is to choose\n",
    "the weights $w$ and bias $b$ such that on average,\n",
    "the predictions made according to our model\n",
    "best fit the true prices observed in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In disciplines where it is common to focus\n",
    "on datasets with just a few features,\n",
    "explicitly expressing models long-form like this is common.\n",
    "In ML, we usually work with high-dimensional datasets,\n",
    "so it is more convenient to employ linear algebra notation.\n",
    "When our inputs consist of $d$ features,\n",
    "we express our prediction $\\hat{y}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = w_1 \\cdot x_1 + ... + w_d \\cdot x_d + b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting all features into a vector $\\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "and all weights into a vector $\\mathbf{w}$,\n",
    "we can express our model compactly using a dot product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x} + b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ corresponds to a single data point.\n",
    "We will often find it convenient\n",
    "to refer to our entire dataset via the *design matrix* $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "Here, $\\mathbf{X}$ contains one row for every example\n",
    "and one column for every feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a collection of data points $\\mathbf{X}$,\n",
    "the predictions $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n",
    "can be expressed via the matrix-vector product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} + b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a training dataset $\\mathbf{X}$\n",
    "and corresponding (known) targets $\\mathbf{y}$,\n",
    "the goal of linear regression is to find\n",
    "the *weight* vector $w$ and bias term $b$\n",
    "that given a new data point $\\mathbf{x}_i$,\n",
    "sampled from the same distribution as the training data\n",
    "will (in expectation) predict the target $y_i$ with the lowest error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we believe that the best model for\n",
    "predicting $y$ given $\\mathbf{x}$ is linear,\n",
    "we would not expect to find real-world data where\n",
    "$y_i$ exactly equals $\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}+b$\n",
    "for all points ($\\mathbf{x}, y)$.\n",
    "For example, whatever instruments we use to observe\n",
    "the features $\\mathbf{X}$ and labels $\\mathbf{y}$\n",
    "might suffer small amount of measurement error.\n",
    "Thus, even when we are confident\n",
    "that the underlying relationship is linear,\n",
    "we will incorporate a noise term to account for such errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can go about searching for the best parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ and $b$,\n",
    "we will need two more things:\n",
    "(i) a quality measure for some given model;\n",
    "and (ii) a procedure for updating the model to improve its quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start thinking about how *to fit* our model,\n",
    "we need to determine a measure of *fitness*.\n",
    "The *loss function* quantifies the distance\n",
    "between the *real* and *predicted* value of the target.\n",
    "The loss will usually be a non-negative number\n",
    "where smaller values are better\n",
    "and perfect predictions incur a loss of $0$.\n",
    "The most popular loss function in regression problems\n",
    "is the sum of squared errors.\n",
    "When our prediction for an example $i$ is $\\hat{y}^{(i)}$\n",
    "and the corresponding true label is $y^{(i)}$,\n",
    "the squared error is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w}, b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\\right)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $1/2$ makes no real difference\n",
    "but will prove notationally convenient,\n",
    "cancelling out when we take the derivative of the loss.\n",
    "Since the training dataset is given to us, and thus out of our control,\n",
    "the empirical error is only a function of the model parameters.\n",
    "To make things more concrete, consider the example below\n",
    "where we plot a regression problem for a one-dimensional case\n",
    "as shown in :numref:`fig_fit_linreg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fit data with a linear model.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/djl-resources/311169c9dbd89e1597a5ae6b0b1ba8a402b8b55e/jupyter/d2l-java/img/Neuron.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_fit_linreg`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that large differences between\n",
    "estimates $\\hat{y}^{(i)}$ and observations $y^{(i)}$\n",
    "lead to even larger contributions to the loss,\n",
    "due to the quadratic dependence.\n",
    "To measure the quality of a model on the entire dataset,\n",
    "we simply average (or equivalently, sum)\n",
    "the losses on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\mathbf{w}, b) =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n l^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w}, b) =\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When training the model, we want to find parameters ($\\mathbf{w}^*, b^*$)\n",
    "that minimize the total loss across all training examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w}^*, b^* = \\operatorname*{argmin}_{\\mathbf{w}, b}\\  L(\\mathbf{w}, b).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytic Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression happens to be an unusually simple optimization problem.\n",
    "Unlike most other models that we will encounter in this book,\n",
    "linear regression can be solved analytically by applying a simple formula,\n",
    "yielding a global optimum.\n",
    "To start, we can subsume the bias $b$ into the parameter $\\mathbf{w}$\n",
    "by appending a column to the design matrix consisting of all $1s$.\n",
    "Then our prediction problem is to minimize $||\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}||$.\n",
    "Because this expression has a quadratic form, it is convex,\n",
    "and so long as the problem is not degenerate\n",
    "(our features are linearly independent), it is strictly convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus there is just one critical point on the loss surface\n",
    "and it corresponds to the global minimum.\n",
    "Taking the derivative of the loss with respect to $\\mathbf{w}$\n",
    "and setting it equal to $0$ yields the analytic solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w}^* = (\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X)^{-1}\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf{y}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While simple problems like linear regression\n",
    "may admit analytic solutions,\n",
    "you should not get used to such good fortune.\n",
    "Although analytic solutions allow for nice mathematical analysis,\n",
    "the requirement of an analytic solution is so restrictive\n",
    "that it would exclude all of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in cases where we cannot solve the models analytically,\n",
    "and even when the loss surfaces are high-dimensional and nonconvex,\n",
    "it turns out that we can still train models effectively in practice.\n",
    "Moreover, for many tasks, these difficult-to-optimize models\n",
    "turn out to be so much better that figuring out how to train them\n",
    "ends up being well worth the trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key technique for optimizing nearly any deep learning model,\n",
    "and which we will call upon throughout this book,\n",
    "consists of iteratively reducing the error\n",
    "by updating the parameters in the direction\n",
    "that incrementally lowers the loss function.\n",
    "This algorithm is called *gradient descent*.\n",
    "On convex loss surfaces, it will eventually converge to a global minimum,\n",
    "and while the same cannot be said for nonconvex surfaces,\n",
    "it will at least lead towards a (hopefully good) local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most naive application of gradient descent\n",
    "consists of taking the derivative of the true loss,\n",
    "which is an average of the losses computed\n",
    "on every single example in the dataset.\n",
    "In practice, this can be extremely slow.\n",
    "We must pass over the entire dataset before making a single update.\n",
    "Thus, we will often settle for sampling a random minibatch of examples\n",
    "every time we need to compute the update,\n",
    "a variant called *stochastic gradient descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each iteration, we first randomly sample a minibatch $\\mathcal{B}$\n",
    "consisting of a fixed number of training examples.\n",
    "We then compute the derivative (gradient) of the average loss\n",
    "on the mini batch with regard to the model parameters.\n",
    "Finally, we multiply the gradient by a predetermined step size $\\eta > 0$\n",
    "and subtract the resulting term from the current parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can express the update mathematically as follows\n",
    "($\\partial$ denotes the partial derivative) :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\mathbf{w},b) \\leftarrow (\\mathbf{w},b) - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}} \\partial_{(\\mathbf{w},b)} l^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w},b).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, steps of the algorithm are the following:\n",
    "(i) we initialize the values of the model parameters, typically at random;\n",
    "(ii) we iteratively sample random batches from the data (many times),\n",
    "updating the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For quadratic losses and linear functions,\n",
    "we can write this out explicitly as follows:\n",
    "Note that $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{x}$ are vectors.\n",
    "Here, the more elegant vector notation makes the math\n",
    "much more readable than expressing things in terms of coefficients,\n",
    "say $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_d$.\n",

    "and $\\eta$ denotes the *learning rate*.\n",
    "We emphasize that the values of the batch size and learning rate\n",
    "are manually pre-specified and not typically learned through model training.\n",
    "These parameters that are tunable but not updated\n",
    "in the training loop are called *hyper-parameters*.\n",
    "*Hyperparameter tuning* is the process by which these are chosen,\n",
    "and typically requires that we adjust the hyperparameters\n",
    "based on the results of the inner (training) loop\n",
    "as assessed on a separate *validation* split of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training for some predetermined number of iterations\n",
    "(or until some other stopping criteria is met),\n",
    "we record the estimated model parameters,\n",
    "denoted $\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}, \\hat{b}$\n",
    "(in general the \"hat\" symbol denotes estimates).\n",
    "Note that even if our function is truly linear and noiseless,\n",
    "these parameters will not be the exact minimizers of the loss\n",
    "because, although the algorithm converges slowly towards a local minimum\n",
    "it cannot achieve it exactly in a finite number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression happens to be a convex learning problem,\n",
    "and thus there is only one (global) minimum.\n",
    "However, for more complicated models, like deep networks,\n",
    "the loss surfaces contain many minima.\n",
    "Fortunately, for reasons that are not yet fully understood,\n",
    "deep learning practitioners seldom struggle to find parameters\n",
    "that minimize the loss *on training data*.\n",
    "The more formidable task is to find parameters\n",
    "that will achieve low loss on data\n",
    "that we have not seen before,\n",

    "is somewhat of a misnomer.\n",
    "In statistics, *inference* more often denotes\n",

    "When training our models, we typically want to process\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Assume that we have some data $x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Our goal is to find a constant $b$ such that $\\sum_i (x_i - b)^2$ is minimized.\n",

    "    * How does this problem and its solution relate to the normal distribution?\n",
    "1. Derive the closed-form solution to the optimization problem for linear regression with squared error. To keep things simple, you can omit the bias $b$ from the problem (we can do this in principled fashion by adding one column to $X$ consisting of all ones).\n",
    "    * Write out the optimization problem in matrix and vector notation (treat all the data as a single matrix, all the target values as a single vector).\n",
    "    * Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to $w$.\n",
    "    * Find the closed form solution by setting the gradient equal to zero and solving the matrix equation.\n",
    "    * When might this be better than using stochastic gradient descent? When might this method break?\n",
    "1. Assume that the noise model governing the additive noise $\\epsilon$ is the exponential distribution. That is, $p(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\exp(-|\\epsilon|)$.\n",
    "    * Write out the negative log-likelihood of the data under the model $-\\log P(Y \\mid X)$.\n",
    "    * Can you find a closed form solution?\n",
    "    * Suggest a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve this problem. What could possibly go wrong (hint - what happens near the stationary point as we keep on updating the parameters). Can you fix this?"
