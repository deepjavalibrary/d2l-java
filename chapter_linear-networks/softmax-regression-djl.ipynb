    "exponentiation can be a source of numerical stability issues\n",
    "(as discussed  in :numref:`sec_naive_bayes`).\n",
    "Recall that the softmax function calculates\n",
    "$\\hat y_j = \\frac{e^{z_j}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{z_i}}$, \n",
    "where $\\hat y_j$ is the $j^\\mathrm{th}$ element of ``yHat`` \n",
    "and $z_j$ is the $j^\\mathrm{th}$ element of the input\n",
    "``yLinear`` variable, as computed by the softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "If some of the $z_i$ are very large (i.e., very positive),\n",
    "then $e^{z_i}$ might be larger than the largest number\n",
    "we can have for certain types of ``float`` (i.e., overflow).\n",
    "This would make the denominator (and/or numerator) ``inf`` \n",
    "and we wind up encountering either $0$, ``inf``, or ``nan`` for $\\hat y_j$.\n",
    "In these situations we do not get a well-defined \n",
    "return value for ``crossEntropy()``.\n",
    "One trick to get around this is to first subtract $\\text{max}(z_i)$\n",

    "You can verify that this shifting of each $z_i$ by constant factor\n",
    "does not change the return value of ``softmax()``.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the subtraction and normalization step,\n",
    "it might be that possible that some $z_j$ have large negative values\n",
    "and thus that the corresponding $e^{z_j}$ will take values close to zero.\n",
    "These might be rounded to zero due to finite precision (i.e underflow),\n",
