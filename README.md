# Dive into Deep Learning (Java version)

This project is modified from the original [Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai) book by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, Alex J. Smola and all the community contributors. 
GitHub of the original book: [https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en). 
We have modified the book to provide implementation in Java using Deep Java Library(DJL).

All the notebook here can be downloaded and run using Java Kernel. We also compiled the book into a [website](https://d2l.djl.ai).

## How to run Jupyter Notebook in Java

Please follow the instruction [here](https://d2l.djl.ai/chapter_installation/index.html) for how to run notebook using Java kernel.


## How to contribute to this book
