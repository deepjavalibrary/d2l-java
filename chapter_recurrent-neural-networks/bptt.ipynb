    "### Full Computation ### \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously,\n",
    "we can just compute the full sum in\n",
    ":eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_gen`.\n",
    "However,\n",
    "this is very slow and gradients can blow up,\n",
    "since subtle changes in the initial conditions can potentially affect the outcome a lot.\n",
    "That is, we could see things similar to the butterfly effect where minimal changes in the initial conditions lead to disproportionate changes in the outcome.\n",
    "This is actually quite undesirable in terms of the model that we want to estimate.\n",
    "After all, we are looking for robust estimators that generalize well. Hence this strategy is almost never used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truncating Time Steps ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively,\n",
    "we can truncate the sum in\n",
    ":eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_gen`\n",
    "after $\\tau$ steps. \n",
    "This is what we have been discussing so far,\n",
    "such as when we detached the gradients in :numref:`sec_rnn_scratch`. \n",
    "This leads to an *approximation* of the true gradient, simply by terminating the sum at \n",
    "$\\partial h_{t-\\tau}/\\partial w_h$. \n",
    "In practice this works quite well. It is what is commonly referred to as truncated backpropgation through time :cite:`Jaeger.2002`.\n",
    "One of the consequences of this is that the model focuses primarily on short-term influence rather than long-term consequences. This is actually *desirable*, since it biases the estimate towards simpler and more stable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomized Truncation ### \n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we can replace $\\partial h_t/\\partial w_h$\n",
    "by a random variable which is correct in expectation but  truncates the sequence.\n",
    "This is achieved by using a sequence of $\\xi_t$\n",
    "with predefined $0 \\leq \\pi_t \\leq 1$,\n",
    "where $P(\\xi_t = 0) = 1-\\pi_t$ and  $P(\\xi_t = \\pi_t^{-1}) = \\pi_t$, thus $E[\\xi_t] = 1$.\n",
    "We use this to replace the gradient\n",
    "$\\partial h_t/\\partial w_h$\n",
    "in :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_recur`\n",
    "with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_t= \\frac{\\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_h)}{\\partial w_h} +\\xi_t \\frac{\\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_h)}{\\partial h_{t-1}} \\frac{\\partial h_{t-1}}{\\partial w_h}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows from the definition of $\\xi_t$ that $E[z_t] = \\partial h_t/\\partial w_h$.\n",
    "Whenever $\\xi_t = 0$ the recurrent computation\n",
    "terminates at that time step $t$.\n",
    "This leads to a weighted sum of sequences of varying lengths where long sequences are rare but appropriately overweighted. \n",
    "This idea was proposed by Tallec and Ollivier\n",

    "\n",
    "* Backpropagation through time is merely an application of backpropagation to sequence models with a hidden state.\n",
    "* Truncation is needed for computational convenience and numerical stability, such as regular truncation and randomized truncation.\n",
    "* High powers of matrices can lead to divergent or vanishing eigenvalues. This manifests itself in the form of exploding or vanishing gradients.\n",
    "* For efficient computation, intermediate values are cached during backpropagation through time.\n",

    "1. Assume that we have a symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ whose corresponding eigenvectors are $\\mathbf{v}_i$ ($i = 1, \\ldots, n$). Without loss of generality, assume that they are ordered in the order $|\\lambda_i| \\geq |\\lambda_{i+1}|$. \n",
    "   1. Show that $\\mathbf{M}^k$ has eigenvalues $\\lambda_i^k$.\n",
    "   1. Prove that for a random vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, with high probability $\\mathbf{M}^k \\mathbf{x}$ will be very much aligned with the eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_1$ \n",
    "of $\\mathbf{M}$. Formalize this statement.\n",
    "   1. What does the above result mean for gradients in RNNs?\n",
    "1. Besides gradient clipping, can you think of any other methods to cope with gradient explosion in recurrent neural networks?"
