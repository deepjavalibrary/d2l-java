    "\n",
    "In :numref:`sec_language_model` we introduced $n$-gram models, where the conditional probability of word $x_t$ at time step $t$ only depends on the $n-1$ previous words.\n",
    "If we want to incorporate the possible effect of words earlier than time step $t-(n-1)$ on $x_t$,\n",
    "we need to increase $n$.\n",
    "However, the number of model parameters would also increase exponentially with it, as we need to store $|\\mathcal{V}|^n$ numbers for a vocabulary set $\\mathcal{V}$.\n",
    "Hence, rather than modeling $P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_{t-n+1})$ it is preferable to use a latent variable model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_1) \\approx P(x_t \\mid h_{t-1}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h_{t-1}$ is a *hidden state* (also known as a hidden variable) that stores the sequence information up to time step $t-1$.\n",
    "In general,\n",
    "the hidden state at any time step $t$ could be computed based on both the current input $x_{t}$ and the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$:\n",

    ":eqlabel:`eq_ht_xt`\n",

    "For a sufficiently powerful function $f$ in :eqref:`eq_ht_xt`, the latent variable model is not an approximation. After all, $h_t$ may simply store all the data it has observed so far.\n",
    "However, it could potentially make both computation and storage expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we have discussed hidden layers with hidden units in :numref:`chap_perceptrons`.\n",
    "It is noteworthy that\n",
    "hidden layers and hidden states refer to two very different concepts.\n",
    "Hidden layers are, as explained, layers that are hidden from view on the path from input to output.\n",
    "Hidden states are technically speaking *inputs* to whatever we do at a given step,\n",
    "and they can only be computed by looking at data at previous time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Recurrent neural networks* (RNNs) are neural networks with hidden states. Before introducing the RNN model, we first revisit the MLP model introduced in :numref:`sec_mlp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Networks without Hidden States\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a look at an MLP with a single hidden layer.\n",
    "Let the hidden layer's activation function be $\\phi$.\n",
    "Given a minibatch of examples $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ with batch size $n$ and $d$ inputs, the hidden layer's output $\\mathbf{H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ is calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H} = \\phi(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{xh} + \\mathbf{b}_h).$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`rnn_h_without_state`\n",
    "\n",
    "In :eqref:`rnn_h_without_state`, we have the weight parameter $\\mathbf{W}_{xh} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times h}$, the bias parameter $\\mathbf{b}_h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times h}$, and the number of hidden units $h$, for the hidden layer. \n",
    "Thus, broadcasting (see :numref:`subsec_broadcasting`) is applied during the summation.\n",
    "Next, the hidden variable $\\mathbf{H}$ is used as the input of the output layer. The output layer is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{O} = \\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{W}_{hq} + \\mathbf{b}_q,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times q}$ is the output variable, $\\mathbf{W}_{hq} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times q}$ is the weight parameter, and $\\mathbf{b}_q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times q}$ is the bias parameter of the output layer.  If it is a classification problem, we can use $\\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{O})$ to compute the probability distribution of the output categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is entirely analogous to the regression problem we solved previously in :numref:`sec_sequence`, hence we omit details.\n",
    "Suffice it to say that we can pick feature-label pairs at random and learn the parameters of our network via automatic differentiation and stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrent Neural Networks with Hidden States\n",
    ":label:`subsec_rnn_w_hidden_states`\n",
    "\n",
    "Matters are entirely different when we have hidden states. Let us look at the structure in some more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have\n",
    "a minibatch of inputs\n",
    "$\\mathbf{X}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$\n",

    "In other words,\n",
    "for a minibatch of $n$ sequence examples,\n",
    "each row of $\\mathbf{X}_t$ corresponds to one example at time step $t$ from the sequence.\n",
    "Next,\n",
    "denote by $\\mathbf{H}_t  \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ the hidden variable of time step $t$.\n",
    "Unlike the MLP, here we save the hidden variable $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ from the previous time step and introduce a new weight parameter $\\mathbf{W}_{hh} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times h}$ to describe how to use the hidden variable of the previous time step in the current time step. Specifically, the calculation of the hidden variable of the current time step is determined by the input of the current time step together with the hidden variable of the previous time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H}_t = \\phi(\\mathbf{X}_t \\mathbf{W}_{xh} + \\mathbf{H}_{t-1} \\mathbf{W}_{hh}  + \\mathbf{b}_h).$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`rnn_h_with_state`\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with :eqref:`rnn_h_without_state`, :eqref:`rnn_h_with_state` adds one more term $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1} \\mathbf{W}_{hh}$ and thus\n",
    "instantiates :eqref:`eq_ht_xt`.\n",
    "From the relationship between hidden variables $\\mathbf{H}_t$ and $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ of adjacent time steps,\n",
    "we know that these variables captured and retained the sequence's historical information up to their current time step, just like the state or memory of the neural network's current time step. Therefore, such a hidden variable is called a *hidden state*.\n",
    "Since the hidden state uses the same definition of the previous time step in the current time step, the computation of :eqref:`rnn_h_with_state` is *recurrent*. Hence, neural networks with hidden states\n",
    "based on recurrent computation are named\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways for constructing RNNs.\n",
    "RNNs with a hidden state defined by :eqref:`rnn_h_with_state` are very common.\n",
    "For time step $t$,\n",
    "the output of the output layer is similar to the computation in the MLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{O}_t = \\mathbf{H}_t \\mathbf{W}_{hq} + \\mathbf{b}_q.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of the RNN\n",
    "include the weights $\\mathbf{W}_{xh} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times h}, \\mathbf{W}_{hh} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times h}$,\n",

    "and the bias $\\mathbf{b}_q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times q}$\n",
    "of the output layer.\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that \n",
    "even at different time steps,\n",
    "RNNs always use these model parameters.\n",
    "Therefore, the parameterization cost of an RNN\n",
    "does not grow as the number of time steps increases.\n",

    ":numref:`fig_rnn` illustrates the computational logic of an RNN at three adjacent time steps.\n",
    "At any time step $t$,\n",
    "the computation of the hidden state can be treated as:\n",
    "i) concatenating the input $\\mathbf{X}_t$ at the current time step $t$ and the hidden state $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$ at the previous time step $t-1$;\n",
    "ii) feeding the concatenation result into a fully-connected layer with the activation function $\\phi$.\n",
    "The output of such a fully-connected layer is the hidden state $\\mathbf{H}_t$ of the current time step $t$.\n",

    "To simplify training in subsequent sections,\n",
    "we tokenize text into characters rather than words\n",
    "and consider a *character-level language model*.\n",

    "Last, let us discuss about how to measure the language model quality, which will be used to evaluate our RNN-based models in the subsequent sections.\n",
    "One way is to check how surprising the text is.\n",
    "A good language model is able to predict with\n",
    "high-accuracy tokens that what we will see next.\n",

    "1. \"It is raining outside\"\n",
    "1. \"It is raining banana tree\"\n",
    "1. \"It is raining piouw;kcj pwepoiut\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of quality, example 1 is clearly the best. The words are sensible and logically coherent.\n",
    "While it might not quite accurately reflect which word follows semantically (\"in San Francisco\" and \"in winter\" would have been perfectly reasonable extensions), the model is able to capture which kind of word follows.\n",
    "Example 2 is considerably worse by producing a nonsensical extension. Nonetheless, at least the model has learned how to spell words and some degree of correlation between words. Last, example 3 indicates a poorly trained model that does not fit data properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might measure the quality of the model by computing  the likelihood of the sequence.\n",
    "Unfortunately this is a number that is hard to understand and difficult to compare.\n",
    "After all, shorter sequences are much more likely to occur than the longer ones,\n",
    "hence evaluating the model on Tolstoy's magnum opus\n",

    "when we introduced the softmax regression\n",

    "and more of information theory is discussed in the [online appendix on information theory](https://d2l.ai/chapter_appendix-mathematics-for-deep-learning/information-theory.html).\n",
    "If we want to compress text, we can ask about\n",
    "predicting the next token given the current set of tokens.\n",
    "A better language model should allow us to predict the next token more accurately.\n",
    "Thus, it should allow us to spend fewer bits in compressing the sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $P$ is given by a language model and $x_t$ is the actual token observed at time step $t$ from the sequence.\n",
    "This makes the performance on documents of different lengths comparable. For historical reasons, scientists in natural language processing prefer to use a quantity called *perplexity*. In a nutshell, it is the exponential of :eqref:`eq_avg_ce_for_lm`:\n",

    "$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^n \\log P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_1)\\right).$$\n",

    "Perplexity can be best understood as the harmonic mean of the number of real choices that we have when deciding which token to pick next. Let us look at a number of cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the best case scenario, the model always perfectly estimates the probability of the label token as 1. In this case the perplexity of the model is 1.\n",
    "* In the worst case scenario, the model always predicts the probability of the label token as 0. In this situation, the perplexity is positive infinity.\n",
    "* At the baseline, the model predicts a uniform distribution over all the available tokens of the vocabulary. In this case, the perplexity equals the number of unique tokens of the vocabulary. In fact, if we were to store the sequence without any compression, this would be the best we could do to encode it. Hence, this provides a nontrivial upper bound that any useful model must beat.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will implement RNNs\n",
    "for character-level language models and use perplexity\n",
    "to evaluate such models.\n",

    "## Summary\n",

    "* A neural network that uses recurrent computation for hidden states is called a recurrent neural network (RNN).\n",
