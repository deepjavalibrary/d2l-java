We collect all the context words every time when $w_i$ is a center word and keep duplicates, denoted as multiset $\\mathcal{C}_i$. The number of an element in a multiset is called the multiplicity of the element. For instance, suppose that word $w_i$ appears twice in the dataset: the context windows when these two $w_i$ become center words in the text sequence contain context word indices $2, 1, 5, 2$ and $2, 3, 2, 1$.

Because $h(0)=0$, the squared loss term for $x_{ij}=0$ can be simply ignored. When we use minibatch SGD for training, we conduct random sampling to get a non-zero minibatch $x_{ij}$ from each time step and compute the gradient to update the model parameters. These non-zero $x_{ij}$ are computed in advance based on the entire dataset and they contain global statistics for the dataset.

Therefore, $x_{ij}=x_{ji}$. Unlike word2vec, GloVe fits the symmetric $\\log\\, x_{ij}$ in lieu of the asymmetric conditional probability $p_{ij}$. Therefore, the central target word vector and context word vector of any word are equivalent in GloVe. However, the two sets of word vectors that are learned by the same word may be different in the end due to different initialization values. After learning all the word vectors, GloVe will use the sum of the central target word vector and the context word vector as the final word vector for the word.\n", "\n", "\n", "## Understanding GloVe from Conditional Probability Ratios\n", "\n", "We can also try to understand GloVe word embedding from another perspective.

We can construct a word vector function to fit the conditional probability ratio more effectively. As we know, to obtain any ratio of this type requires three words $w_i$, $w_j$, and $w_k$. The conditional probability ratio with $w_i$ as the central target word is ${p_{ij}}/{p_{ik}}$. We can find a function that uses word vectors to fit this conditional probability ratio.\n", "\n", "$$f(\\mathbf{u}_j, \\mathbf{u}_k, {\\mathbf{v}}_i) \\approx \\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{ik}}.$$\n", "\n", "The possible design of function $f$ here will not be unique.
