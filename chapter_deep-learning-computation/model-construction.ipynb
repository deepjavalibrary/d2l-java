    "# Layers and Blocks\n",
    ":label:`sec_model_construction`\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first introduced neural networks,\n",
    "we focused on linear models with a single output.\n",
    "Here, the entire model consists of just a single neuron.\n",
    "Note that a single neuron\n",
    "(i) takes some set of inputs;\n",
    "(ii) generates a corresponding (*scalar*) output;\n",
    "and (iii) has a set of associated parameters that can be updated \n",
    "to optimize some objective function of interest.\n",
    "Then, once we started thinking about networks with multiple outputs,\n",
    "we leveraged vectorized arithmetic\n",
    "to characterize an entire *layer* of neurons.\n",
    "Just like individual neurons, \n",
    "layers (i) take a set of inputs, \n",
    "(ii) generate corresponding outputs,\n",
    "and (iii) are described by a set of tunable parameters.\n",
    "When we worked through softmax regression,\n",
    "a single *layer* was itself *the model*.\n",
    "However, even when we subsequently \n",
    "introduced multilayer perceptrons,\n",
    "we could still think of the model as \n",
    "retaining this same basic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, for multilayer perceptrons, \n",
    "both the *entire model* and its *constituent layers* \n",
    "share this structure. \n",
    "The (entire) model takes in raw inputs (the features),\n",
    "generates outputs (the predictions),\n",
    "and possesses parameters \n",
    "(the combined parameters from all constituent layers).\n",
    "Likewise, each individual layer ingests inputs \n",
    "(supplied by the previous layer)\n",
    "generates outputs (the inputs to the subsequent layer),\n",
    "and possesses a set of tunable parameters that are updated\n",
    "according to the signal that flows backwards \n",
    "from the subsequent layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While you might think that neurons, layers, and models\n",
    "give us enough abstractions to go about our business,\n",
    "it turns out that we often find it convenient\n",
    "to speak about components that are\n",
    "larger than an individual layer\n",
    "but smaller than the entire model.\n",
    "For example, the ResNet-152 architecture,\n",
    "which is wildly popular in computer vision,\n",
    "possesses hundreds of layers.\n",
    "These layers consist of repeating patterns of *groups of layers*. Implementing such a network one layer at a time can grow tedious.\n",
    "This concern is not just hypothetical---such \n",
    "design patterns are common in practice.\n",
    "The ResNet architecture mentioned above\n",
    "won the 2015 ImageNet and COCO computer vision competitions\n",
    "for both recognition and detection :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016`\n",
    "and remains a go-to architecture for many vision tasks.\n",
    "Similar architectures in which layers are arranged \n",
    "in various repeating patterns \n",
    "are now ubiquitous in other domains,\n",
    "including natural language processing and speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement these complex networks,\n",
    "we introduce the concept of a neural network *block*.\n",
    "A block could describe a single layer,\n",
    "a component consisting of multiple layers,\n",
    "or the entire model itself!\n",
    "From a software standpoint, a `Block` is a *class*.\n",
    "Any subclass of `Block` must define a `forward` method \n",
    "that transforms its input into output\n",
    "and must store any necessary parameters.\n",
    "Note that some Blocks do not require any parameters at all!\n",
    "Finally a `Block` must possess a `backward` method,\n",
    "for purposes of calculating gradients.\n",
    "Fortunately, due to some behind-the-scenes magic\n",
    "supplied by the `autograd` package\n",
    "(introduced in :numref:`chap_preliminaries`)\n",
    "when defining our own `Block`,\n",
    "we only need to worry about parameters\n",
    "and the `forward` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of working with the `Block` abstraction \n",
    "is that they can be combined into larger artifacts,\n",
    "often recursively, (see illustration in :numref:`fig_blocks`).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Multiple layers are combined into blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/2885330e548958282a8dec1dca724eb0e533cfa9/img/blocks.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_blocks`\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining code to generate Blocks \n",
    "of arbitrary complexity on demand,\n",
    "we can write surprisingly compact code\n",
    "and still implement complex neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we revisit the Blocks \n",
    "that we used to implement multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "(:numref:`sec_mlp_djl`).\n",
    "The following code generates a network\n",
    "with one fully-connected hidden layer \n",
    "with 256 units and ReLU activation,\n",
    "followed by a fully-connected *output layer*\n",
    "with 10 units (no activation function)."

    "   an output of dimension 256.\n",
    "1. Calculate the gradient of its output with respect to its input,      which can be accessed via its `backward()` method. \n",
    "   Typically this happens automatically.\n",
    "1. Store and provide access to those parameters necessary \n",
    "   to execute the `forward()` computation.\n",
    "1. Initialize these parameters as needed.\n",

    "with one hidden layer with 256 hidden nodes, \n",
    "and a 10-dimensional output layer.\n",
    "Note that the `MLP` class below inherits the `AbstractBlock` class.\n",
