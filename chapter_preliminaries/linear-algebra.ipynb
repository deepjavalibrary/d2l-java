    ":label:`sec_linear-algebra`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can store and manipulate data,\n",
    "let us briefly review the subset of basic linear algebra\n",
    "that you will need to understand and implement\n",
    "most of models covered in this book.\n",
    "Below, we introduce the basic mathematical objects, arithmetic,\n",
    "and operations in linear algebra,\n",
    "expressing each of them through mathematical notation\n",
    "and the corresponding implementation in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "If you never studied linear algebra or machine learning,\n",
    "then your past experience with math probably consisted\n",
    "of thinking about one number at a time.\n",
    "And, if you ever balanced a checkbook\n",
    "or even paid for dinner at a restaurant\n",
    "then you already know how to do basic things\n",
    "like adding and multiplying pairs of numbers.\n",
    "For example, the temperature in Palo Alto is $52$ degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
    "Formally, we call values consisting\n",
    "of just one numerical quantity *scalars*.\n",
    "If you wanted to convert this value to Celsius\n",
    "(the metric system's more sensible temperature scale),\n",
    "you would evaluate the expression $c = \\frac{5}{9}(f - 32)$, setting $f$ to $52$.\n",
    "In this equation, each of the terms---$5$, $9$, and $32$---are scalar values.\n",
    "The placeholders $c$ and $f$ are called *variables*\n",
    "and they represent unknown scalar values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, we adopt the mathematical notation\n",
    "where scalar variables are denoted\n",
    "by ordinary lower-cased letters (e.g., $x$, $y$, and $z$).\n",
    "We denote the space of all (continuous) *real-valued* scalars by $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "For expedience, we will punt on rigorous definitions\n",
    "of what precisely *space* is,\n",
    "but just remember for now that the expression $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "is a formal way to say that $x$ is a real-valued scalar.\n",
    "The symbol $\\in$ can be pronounced \"in\"\n",
    "and simply denotes membership in a set.\n",
    "Analogously, we could write $x, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "to state that $x$ and $y$ are numbers\n",
    "whose value can only be $0$ or $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scalar is represented by a NDArray with just one element.\n",
    "In the next snippet, we instantiate two scalars\n",
    "and perform some familiar arithmetic operations with them,\n",
    "namely addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and NDArrays are basic mathematical objects in linear algebra.\n",
    "* Vectors generalize scalars, and matrices generalize vectors.\n",
    "* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and NDArrays have zero, one, two, and an arbitrary number of axes, respectively.\n",
    "* A NDArray can be reduced along the specified axes by `sum` and `mean`.\n",
    "* Elementwise multiplication of two matrices is called their Hadamard product. It is different from matrix multiplication.\n",
    "* In deep learning, we often work with norms such as the $L_1$ norm, the $L_2$ norm, and the Frobenius norm.\n",
    "* We can perform a variety of operations over scalars, vectors, matrices, and NDArrays.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Prove that the transpose of a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$'s transpose is $\\mathbf{A}$: $(\\mathbf{A}^\\top)^\\top = \\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "1. Given two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, show that the sum of transposes is equal to the transpose of a sum: $\\mathbf{A}^\\top + \\mathbf{B}^\\top = (\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B})^\\top$.\n",
    "1. Given any square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, is $\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A}^\\top$ always symmetric? Why?\n",
    "1. We defined the NDArray `X` of shape (2, 3, 4) in this section. What is the output of `X.size()`?\n",
    "1. For a NDArray `X` of arbitrary shape, does `X.size()` always correspond to the length of a certain axis of `X`? What is that axis?\n",
    "1. Run `A.div(A.sum(new int[] {1}))` and see what happens. Can you analyze the reason?\n",
    "1. When traveling between two points in Manhattan, what is the distance that you need to cover in terms of the coordinates, i.e., in terms of avenues and streets? Can you travel diagonally?\n",
    "1. Consider a NDArray with shape (2, 3, 4). What are the shapes of the summation outputs along axis 0, 1, and 2?\n",
    "1. Feed a NDArray with 3 or more axes to the `l2Norm` function and observe its output. What does this function compute for NDArrays of arbitrary shape?\n"
