    "Finding the area of a polygon had remained mysterious\n",
    "until at least 2,500 years ago, when ancient Greeks divided a polygon into triangles and summed their areas.\n",
    "To find the area of curved shapes, such as a circle,\n",
    "ancient Greeks inscribed polygons in such shapes.\n",
    "As shown in :numref:`fig_circle_area`,\n",
    "an inscribed polygon with more sides of equal length better approximates\n",
    "the circle. This process is also known as the *method of exhaustion*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Find the area of a circle with the method of exhaustion.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/master/img/polygon-circle.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_circle_area`\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the method of exhaustion is where *integral calculus* (will be described in :numref:`sec_integral_calculus`) originates from.\n",
    "More than 2,000 years later,\n",
    "the other branch of calculus, *differential calculus*,\n",
    "was invented.\n",
    "Among the most critical applications of differential calculus,\n",
    "optimization problems consider how to do something *the best*.\n",
    "As discussed in :numref:`subsec_norms_and_objectives`,\n",
    "such problems are ubiquitous in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, we *train* models, updating them successively\n",
    "so that they get better and better as they see more and more data.\n",
    "Usually, getting better means minimizing a *loss function*,\n",
    "a score that answers the question \"how *bad* is our model?\"\n",
    "This question is more subtle than it appears.\n",
    "Ultimately, what we really care about\n",
    "is producing a model that performs well on data\n",
    "that we have never seen before.\n",
    "But we can only fit the model to data that we can actually see.\n",
    "Thus we can decompose the task of fitting models into two key concerns:\n",
    "i) *optimization*: the process of fitting our models to observed data;\n",
    "ii) *generalization*: the mathematical principles and practitioners' wisdom\n",
    "that guide as to how to produce models whose validity extends\n",

    "\n",
    "We begin by addressing the calculation of derivatives,\n",
    "a crucial step in nearly all deep learning optimization algorithms.\n",
    "In deep learning, we typically choose loss functions\n",
    "that are differentiable with respect to our model's parameters.\n",
    "Put simply, this means that for each parameter,\n",
    "we can determine how rapidly the loss would increase or decrease,\n",
    "were we to *increase* or *decrease* that parameter\n",
    "by an infinitesimally small amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$,\n",
    "whose input and output are both scalars.\n",
    "The *derivative* of $f$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h},$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_derivative`\n",
    "\n",
    "if this limit exists.\n",
    "If $f'(a)$ exists,\n",
    "$f$ is said to be *differentiable* at $a$.\n",
    "If $f$ is differentiable at every number of an interval,\n",
    "then this function is differentiable on this interval.\n",
    "We can interpret the derivative $f'(x)$ in :eqref:`eq_derivative`\n",
    "as the *instantaneous* rate of change of $f(x)$\n",
    "with respect to $x$.\n",
    "The so-called instantaneous rate of change is based on\n",
    "the variation $h$ in $x$, which approaches $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate derivatives,\n",
    "let us experiment with an example.\n",
    "Define $u = f(x) = 3x^2-4x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: We will be using Double in this section to avoid incorrect results since Double provides more decimal precision. Generally though, we would use Float as deep learning frameworks by default use Fault.*"

    "* Differential calculus and integral calculus are two branches of calculus, where the former can be applied to the ubiquitous optimization problems in deep learning.\n",
    "* A derivative can be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to its variable. It is also the slope of the tangent line to the curve of the function.\n",
    "* A gradient is a vector whose components are the partial derivatives of a multivariate function with respect to all its variables.\n",
