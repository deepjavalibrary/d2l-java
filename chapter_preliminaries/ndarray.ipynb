    "# Data Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    ":label:`sec_ndarray`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get anything done, we need some way to store and manipulate data. \n",
    "Generally, there are two important things we need to do with data: \n",
    "(i) acquire them; and (ii) process them once they are inside the computer. \n",
    "There is no point in acquiring data without some way to store it, \n",
    "so let us get our hands dirty first by playing with synthetic data. \n",
    "To start, we introduce the $n$-dimensional array (`ndarray`), \n",
    "MXNet's primary tool for storing and transforming data.\n",
    "In MXNet, `ndarray` is a class and we call any instance \"an `ndarray`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have worked with NumPy, the most widely-used \n",
    "scientific computing package in Python, \n",
    "then you will find this section familiar.\n",
    "That's by design. We designed MXNet's `ndarray` to be \n",
    "an extension to NumPy's `ndarray` with a few killer features.\n",
    "First, MXNet's `ndarray` supports asynchronous computation \n",
    "on CPU, GPU, and distributed cloud architectures, \n",
    "whereas NumPy only supports CPU computation. \n",
    "Second, MXNet's `ndarray` supports automatic differentiation. \n",
    "These properties make MXNet's `ndarray` suitable for deep learning.\n",
    "Throughout the book, when we say `ndarray`, \n",
    "we are referring to MXNet's `ndarray` unless otherwise stated.\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we aim to get you up and running,\n",
    "equipping you with the basic math and numerical computing tools\n",
    "that you will build on as you progress through the book. \n",
    "Do not worry if you struggle to grok some of \n",
    "the mathematical concepts or library functions. \n",
    "The following sections will revisit this material \n",
    "in the context of practical examples and it will sink. \n",
    "On the other hand, if you already have some background \n",
    "and want to go deeper into the mathematical content, just skip this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we import the `api`, `mxnet-engine` and \n",
    "`mxnet-native-auto` modules from Deep Java Library on maven. \n",
    "Here, the `api` module includes all high level Java APIs that will be used for data processing, training and inference. The `mxnet-engine` includes the implementation of those high level APIs using Apache MXnet framework.\n",
    "The `mxnet-native-auto` module contains the MXNet native libraries with basic operators and functions implemented in C++."
