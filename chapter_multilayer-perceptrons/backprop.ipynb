    "So far, we have trained our models \n",
    "with minibatch stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "However, when we implemented the algorithm,\n",
    "we only worried about the calculations involved\n",
    "in *forward propagation* through the model.\n",
    "When it came time to calculate the gradients,\n",
    "we just invoked the `backward` function,\n",
    "relying on the `GradientCollector` module to know what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The automatic calculation of gradients profoundly simplifies\n",
    "the implementation of deep learning algorithms.\n",
    "Before automatic differentiation,\n",
    "even small changes to complicated models required\n",
    "recalculating complicated derivatives by hand.\n",
    "Surprisingly often, academic papers had to allocate\n",
    "numerous pages to deriving update rules.\n",
    "While we must continue to rely on `GradientCollector`\n",
    "so we can focus on the interesting parts,\n",
    "you ought to *know* how these gradients\n",

    "if you want to go beyond a shallow \n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we take a deep dive \n",
    "into the details of backward propagation \n",
    "(more commonly called *backpropagation* or *backprop*).\n",
    "To convey some insight for both the \n",
    "techniques and their implementations,\n",
    "we rely on some basic mathematics and computational graphs.\n",

    "## Forward Propagation\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, letâ€™s assume\n",
    "that the input example is $\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$\n",
    "and that our hidden layer does not include a bias term.\n",
    "Here the intermediate variable is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{z}= \\mathbf{W}^{(1)} \\mathbf{x},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{W}^{(1)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times d}$\n",

    "After running the intermediate variable \n",
    "$\\mathbf{z}\\in \\mathbb{R}^h$ through the \n",
    "activation function $\\phi$ \n",
    "we obtain our hidden activation vector of length $h$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}= \\phi (\\mathbf{z}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden variable $\\mathbf{h}$ \n",
    "is also an intermediate variable.\n",
    "Assuming the parameters of the output layer\n",
    "only possess a weight of \n",

    "$$\\mathbf{o}= \\mathbf{W}^{(2)} \\mathbf{h}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the loss function is $l$ \n",
    "and the example label is $y$,\n",
    "we can then calculate the loss term \n",
    "for a single data example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = l(\\mathbf{o}, y).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the definition of $\\ell_2$ regularization,\n",

    "the regularization term is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\left(\\|\\mathbf{W}^{(1)}\\|_F^2 + \\|\\mathbf{W}^{(2)}\\|_F^2\\right),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the Frobenius norm of the matrix \n",
    "is simply the $L_2$ norm applied \n",
    "after flattening the matrix into a vector.\n",
    "Finally, the model's regularized loss\n",
    "on a given data example is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here we use the $\\text{prod}$ operator\n",
    "to multiply its arguments \n",

    "calculate the gradients $\\partial J/\\partial \\mathbf{W}^{(1)}$\n",
    "and $\\partial J/\\partial \\mathbf{W}^{(2)}$.\n",
    "To accomplish this, we apply the chain rule\n",
    "and calculate, in turn, the gradient of\n",
    "each intermediate variable and parameter.\n",
    "The order of calculations are reversed\n",
    "relative to those performed in forward propagation,\n",
    "since we need to start with the outcome of the compute graph\n",
    "and work our way towards the parameters.\n",
    "The first step is to calculate the gradients\n",

    "\n",

    "## Training a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When training networks, \n",
    "forward and backward propagation depend on each other. \n",
    "In particular, for forward propagation,\n",
    "we traverse the compute graph in the direction of dependencies\n",
    "and compute all the variables on its path.\n",
    "These are then used for backpropagation\n",
    "where the compute order on the graph is reversed.\n",
    "One of the consequences is that we need to retain\n",
    "the intermediate values until backpropagation is complete.\n",
    "This is also one of the reasons why backpropagation\n",
    "requires significantly more memory than plain prediction.\n",
    "We compute tensors as gradients and \n",
    "need to retain all the intermediate variables\n",
    "to invoke the chain rule.\n",
    "Another reason is that we typically train\n",
    "with minibatches containing more than one variable,\n",
    "thus more intermediate activations need to be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forward propagation sequentially calculates and stores intermediate variables within the compute graph defined by the neural network. It proceeds from input to output layer.\n",
    "* Back propagation sequentially calculates and stores the gradients of intermediate variables and parameters within the neural network in the reversed order.\n",
    "* When training deep learning models, forward propagation and back propagation are interdependent.\n",
    "* Training requires significantly more memory and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume that the inputs $\\mathbf{x}$ to some scalar function $f$ are $n \\times m$ matrices. What is the dimensionality of the gradient of $f$ with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$?\n",
    "1. Add a bias to the hidden layer of the model described in this section.\n",
    "    * Draw the corresponding compute graph.\n",
    "    * Derive the forward and backward propagation equations.\n",
    "1. Compute the memory footprint for training and inference in model described in the current chapter.\n",
    "1. Assume that you want to compute *second* derivatives. What happens to the compute graph? How long do you expect the calculation to take?\n",
    "1. Assume that the compute graph is too large for your GPU.\n",
    "    * Can you partition it over more than one GPU?\n",
    "    * What are the advantages and disadvantages over training on a smaller minibatch?\n",
