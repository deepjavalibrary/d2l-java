    "In the previous chapter, we introduced \n",
    "softmax regression (:numref:`sec_softmax`), \n",
    "implementing the algorithm from scratch \n",
    "(:numref:`sec_softmax_scratch`) and in DJL \n",
    "(:numref:`sec_softmax_djl`)\n",
    "and training classifiers to recognize \n",
    "10 categories of clothing from low-resolution images.\n",
    "Along the way, we learned how to wrangle data,\n",
    "coerce our outputs into a valid probability distribution \n",
    "(via `softmax`),\n",
    "apply an appropriate loss function,\n",
    "and to minimize it with respect to our model's parameters.\n",
    "Now that we have mastered these mechanics\n",
    "in the context of simple linear models,\n",
    "we can launch our exploration of deep neural networks,\n",
    "the comparatively rich class of models \n",
    "with which this book is primarily concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, recall the model architecture \n",
    "corresponding to our softmax regression example,\n",
    "illustrated in  :numref:`fig_singlelayer` below.\n",
    "This model mapped our inputs directly to our outputs\n",
    "via a single linear transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\mathbf{o}} = \\mathrm{softmax}(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If our labels truly were related \n",
    "to our input data by a linear function, \n",
    "then this approach would be sufficient.\n",
    "But linearity is a *strong assumption*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, linearity implies the *weaker*\n",
    "assumption of *monotonicity*: \n",
    "that any increase in our feature must\n",
    "either always cause an increase in our model's output \n",
    "(if the corresponding weight is positive),\n",
    "or always always cause a decrease in our model's output\n",
    "(if the corresponding weight is negative).\n",
    "Sometimes that makes sense. \n",
    "For example, if we were trying to predict \n",
    "whether an individual will repay a loan,\n",
    "we might reasonably imagine that holding all else equal,\n",
    "an applicant with a higher income\n",
    "would always be more likely to repay \n",
    "than one with a lower income.\n",
    "While monotonic, this relationship likely\n",
    "is not linearly associated with the probability of \n",
    "repayment. An increase in income from $0 to $50k \n",
    "likely corresponds to a bigger increase \n",
    "in likelihood of repayment \n",
    "than an increase from $1M to $1.05M.\n",
    "One way to handle this might be to pre-process\n",
    "our data such that linearity becomes more plausible, \n",
    "say, by using the logarithm of income as our feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can easily come up with examples\n",
    "that violate *monotonicity*.\n",
    "Say for example that we want to predict probability\n",
    "of death based on body temperature. \n",
    "For individuals with a body temperature \n",
    "above 37°C (98.6°F),\n",
    "higher termperatures indicate greater risk.\n",
    "However, for individuals with body termperatures\n",
    "below 37° C, higher temperatures indicate *lower* risk! \n",
    "In this case too, we might resolve the problem \n",
    "with some clever preprocessing. \n",
    "Namely, we might use the *distance* from 37°C as our feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about classifying images of cats and dogs?\n",
    "Should increasing the intensity \n",
    "of the pixel at location (13, 17)\n",
    "always increase (or always decrease) \n",
    "the likelihood that the image depicts a dog?\n",
    "Reliance on a linear model corrsponds to the (implicit)\n",
    "assumption that the only requirement\n",
    "for differentiating cats vs. dogs is to assess \n",
    "the brightness of individual pixels.\n",
    "This approach is doomed to fail in a world\n",
    "where inverting an image preserves the category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And yet despite the apparent absurdity of linearity here,\n",
    "as compared to our previous examples, \n",
    "it is less obvious that we could address the problem\n",
    "with a simple preprocessing fix. \n",
    "That is because the significance of any pixel\n",
    "depends in complex ways on its context \n",
    "(the values of the surrounding pixels).\n",
    "While there might exist a representation of our data\n",
    "that would take into account \n",
    "the relevant interactions among our features \n",
    "(and on top of which a linear model would be suitable),\n",
    "we simply do not know how to calculate it by hand.\n",
    "With deep neural networks, we used observational data\n",
    "to jointly learn both a representation (via hidden layers)\n",
    "and a linear predictor that acts upon that representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incorporating Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "We can overcome these limitations of linear models\n",
    "and handle a more general class of functions\n",
    "by incorporating one or more hidden layers.\n",
    "The easiest way to do this is to stack\n",
    "many fully-connected layers on top of each other.\n",
    "Each layer feeds into the layer above it, \n",
    "until we generate an output.\n",
    "We can think of the first $L-1$ layers \n",
    "as our representation and the final layer\n",
    "as our linear predictor. \n",
    "This architecture is commonly called \n",
    "a *multilayer perceptron*,\n",
    "often abbreviated as *MLP*.\n",
    "Below, we depict an MLP diagramtically (:numref:`fig_mlp`).\n",

    "This multilayer perceptron has 4 inputs, 3 outputs,\n",
    "and its hidden layer contains 5 hidden units.\n",
    "Since the input layer does not involve any calculations,\n",
    "producing outputs with this network\n",
    "requires implementing the computations \n",
    "for each of the 2 layers (hidden and output).\n",
    "Note that these layers are both fully connected.\n",
    "Every input influences every neuron in the hidden layer,\n",
    "and each of these in turn influences \n",
    "every neuron in the output layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "### From Linear to Nonlinear\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we calculate each layer \n",

    "\n",
    "Note that after adding this layer,\n",
    "our model now requires us to track and update\n",
    "two additional sets of parameters.\n",
    "So what have we gained in exchange?\n",
    "You might be surprised to find out \n",
    "that---in the model defined above---*we \n",
    "gain nothing for our troubles!*\n",
    "The reason is plain. \n",
    "The hidden units above are given by \n",
    "a linear function of the inputs,\n",
    "and the outputs (pre-softmax) are just \n",
    "a linear function of the hidden units.\n",
    "A linear function of a linear function \n",
    "is itself a linear function.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can view the equivalence formally\n",
    "by proving that for any values of the weights,\n",

    "The most popular choice for the nonlinearity \n",

    "for instance, basic logic operations on a pair of inputs.\n",
    "Moreover, for certain choices of the activation function,\n",
    "it is widely known that MLPs are universal approximators.\n",
    "Even with a single-hidden-layer network,\n",

    "i.e., one observation at a time.\n",
    "Note that we are also using the notation for *softmax* \n",
    "in the same way to denote a row-wise operation.\n",
    "Often, as in this section, the activation functions\n",
    "that we apply to hidden layers are not merely row-wise, \n",

    "That means that after computing the linear portion of the layer,\n",
    "we can calculate each nodes activation \n",
    "without looking at the values taken by the other hidden units.\n",
    "This is true for most activation functions\n",

    "\n",
    "* The multilayer perceptron adds one or multiple fully-connected hidden layers between the output and input layers and transforms the output of the hidden layer via an activation function.\n",
    "* Commonly-used activation functions include the ReLU function, the sigmoid function, and the tanh function.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the derivative of the tanh and the pReLU activation function.\n",
    "1. Show that a multilayer perceptron using only ReLU (or pReLU) constructs a continuous piecewise linear function.\n",
    "1. Show that $\\mathrm{tanh}(x) + 1 = 2 \\mathrm{sigmoid}(2x)$.\n",
    "1. Assume we have a multilayer perceptron *without* nonlinearities between the layers. In particular, assume that we have $d$ input dimensions, $d$ output dimensions and that one of the layers has only $d/2$ dimensions. Show that this network is less expressive (powerful) than a single layer perceptron.\n",
    "1. Assume that we have a nonlinearity that applies to one minibatch at a time. What kinds of problems do you expect this to cause?\n"
