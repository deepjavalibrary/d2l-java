Later on, we deploy this network to score new data $(x, y)$ drawn from the same distribution. This is the default assumption for any of the problems that we discuss here. For instance, we might train a cat detector based on lots of pictures of cats and dogs. Once we trained it, we ship it as part of a smart catdoor computer vision system that lets only cats in. This is then installed in a customer's home and is never updated again (barring extreme circumstances).\n", "* **Online Learning.** Now imagine that the data $(x_i, y_i)$ arrives one sample at a time. More specifically, assume that we first observe $x_i$, then we need to come up with an estimate $f(x_i, w)$ and only once we have done this, we observe $y_i$ and with it, we receive a reward (or incur a loss), given our decision. Many real problems fall into this category. E.g., we need to predict tomorrow's stock price, this allows us to trade based on that estimate and at the end of the day we find out whether our estimate allowed us to make a profit. In other words, we have the following cycle where we are continuously improving our model given new observations.\n", "\n", "$$\n", "\\mathrm{model} ~ f_t \\longrightarrow\n", "\\mathrm{data} ~ x_t \\longrightarrow\n", "\\mathrm{estimate} ~ f_t(x_t) \\longrightarrow\n", "\\mathrm{observation} ~ y_t \\longrightarrow\n", "\\mathrm{loss} ~ l(y_t, f_t(x_t)) \\longrightarrow\n", "\\mathrm{model} ~ f_{t+1}\n", "$$\n", "\n", "* **Bandits.** They are a *special case* of the problem above. While in most learning problems we have a continuously parametrized function $f$ where we want to learn its parameters (e.g., a deep network), in a bandit problem we only have a finite number of arms that we can pull (i.e., a finite number of actions that we can take). It is not very surprising that for this simpler problem stronger theoretical guarantees in terms of optimality can be obtained. We list it mainly since this problem is often (confusingly) treated as if it were a distinct learning setting.\n", "* **Control (and nonadversarial Reinforcement Learning).** In many cases the environment remembers what we did. Not necessarily in an adversarial manner but it will just remember and the response will depend on what happened before. E.g., a coffee boiler controller will observe different temperatures depending on whether it was heating the boiler previously. PID (proportional integral derivative) controller algorithms are a popular choice there. Likewise, a user's behavior on a news site will depend on what we showed him previously (e.g., he will read most news only once). Many such algorithms form a model of the environment in which they act such as to make their decisions appear less random (i.e., to reduce variance).\n", "* **Reinforcement Learning.** In the more general case of an environment with memory, we may encounter situations where the environment is trying to *cooperate* with us (cooperative games, in particular for non-zero-sum games), or others where the environment will try to *win*. Chess, Go, Backgammon or StarCraft are some of the cases. Likewise, we might want to build a good controller for autonomous cars. The other cars are likely to respond to the autonomous car's driving style in nontrivial ways, e.g., trying to avoid it, trying to cause an accident, trying to cooperate with it, etc.\n", "\n", "One key distinction between the different situations above is that the same strategy that might have worked throughout in the case of a stationary environment, might not work throughout when the environment can adapt. For instance, an arbitrage opportunity discovered by a trader is likely to disappear once he starts exploiting it. The speed and manner at which the environment changes determines to a large extent the type of algorithms that we can bring to bear. For instance, if we *know* that things may only change slowly, we can force any estimate to change only slowly, too. If we know that the environment might change instantaneously, but only very infrequently, we can make allowances for that. These types of knowledge are crucial for the aspiring data scientist to deal with concept shift, i.e., when the problem that he is trying to solve changes over time.\n", "\n", "\n", "## Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning\n", "\n", "Finally, it is important to remember\n", "that when you deploy machine learning systems\n", "you are not merely optimizing a predictive model---you \n", "are typically providing a tool that will\n", "be used to (partially or fully) automate decisions.\n", "These technical systems can impact the lives\n", "of individuals subject to the resulting decisions.\n", "The leap from considering predictions to decisions\n", "raises not only new technical questions,\n", "but also a slew of ethical questions \n", "that must be carefully considered.\n", "If we are deploying a medical diagnostic system,\n", "we need to know for which populations \n", "it may work and which it may not.\n", "Overlooking foreseeable risks to the welfare of \n", "a subpopulation could cause us to administer inferior care.\n", "Moreover, once we contemplate decision-making systems,\n", "we must step back and reconsider how we evaluate our technology.\n", "Among other consequences of this change of scope,\n", "we will find that *accuracy* is seldom the right metric.\n", "For instance, when translating predictions into actions,\n", "we will often want to take into account \n", "the potential cost sensitivity of erring in various ways.\n", "If one way of misclassifying an image \n", "could be perceived as a racial sleight,\n", "while misclassification to a different category\n", "would be harmless, then we might want to adjust \n", "our thresholds accordingly, accounting for societal values\n", "in designing the decision-making protocol.\n", "We also want to be careful about \n", "how prediction systems can lead to feedback loops.\n", "For example, consider predictive policing systems,\n", "which allocate patrol officers \n", "to areas with high forecasted crime.\n", "It is easy to see how a worrying pattern can emerge:\n", "\n", " 1.
