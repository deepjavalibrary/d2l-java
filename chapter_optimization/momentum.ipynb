    "# Momentum\n",
    ":label:`sec_momentum`\n",
    "\n",
    "In :numref:`sec_sgd` we reviewed what happens when performing stochastic gradient descent, i.e., when performing optimization where only a noisy variant of the gradient is available. In particular, we noticed that for noisy gradients we need to be extra cautious when it comes to choosing the learning rate in the face of noise. If we decrease it too rapidly, convergence stalls. If we are too lenient, we fail to converge to a good enough solution since noise keeps on driving us away from optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore more effective optimization algorithms, especially for certain types of optimization problems that are common in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leaky Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous section saw us discussing minibatch SGD as a means for accelerating computation. It also had the nice side-effect that averaging gradients reduced the amount of variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{g}_t = \\partial_{\\mathbf{w}} \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}_t|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} f(\\mathbf{x}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{t-1}) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}_t|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} \\mathbf{g}_{i, t-1}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we used $\\mathbf{g}_{ii} = \\partial_{\\mathbf{w}} f(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{w}_t)$ to keep the notation simple.\n",
    "It would be nice if we could benefit from the effect of variance reduction even beyond averaging gradients on a mini-batch. One option to accomplish this task is to replace the gradient computation by a \"leaky average\":\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}_t = \\beta \\mathbf{v}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{g}_{t, t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some $\\beta \\in (0, 1)$. This effectively replaces the instantaneous gradient by one that's been averaged over multiple *past* gradients. $\\mathbf{v}$ is called *momentum*. It accumulates past gradients similar to how a heavy ball rolling down the objective function landscape integrates over past forces. To see what is happening in more detail let us expand $\\mathbf{v}_t$ recursively into\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\mathbf{v}_t = \\beta^2 \\mathbf{v}_{t-2} + \\beta \\mathbf{g}_{t-1, t-2} + \\mathbf{g}_{t, t-1}\n",
    "= \\ldots, = \\sum_{\\tau = 0}^{t-1} \\beta^{\\tau} \\mathbf{g}_{t-\\tau, t-\\tau-1}.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Large $\\beta$ amounts to a long-range average, whereas small $\\beta$ amounts to only a slight correction relative to a gradient method. The new gradient replacement no longer points into the direction of steepest descent on a particular instance any longer but rather in the direction of a weighted average of past gradients. This allows us to realize most of the benefits of averaging over a batch without the cost of actually computing the gradients on it. We will revisit this averaging procedure in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above reasoning formed the basis for what is now known as *accelerated* gradient methods, such as gradients with momentum. They enjoy the additional benefit of being much more effective in cases where the optimization problem is ill-conditioned (i.e., where there are some directions where progress is much slower than in others, resembling a narrow canyon). Furthermore, they allow us to average over subsequent gradients to obtain more stable directions of descent. Indeed, the aspect of acceleration even for noise-free convex problems is one of the key reasons why momentum works and why it works so well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one would expect, due to its efficacy momentum is a well-studied subject in optimization for deep learning and beyond. See e.g., the beautiful [expository article](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) by :cite:`Goh.2017` for an in-depth analysis and interactive animation. It was proposed by :cite:`Polyak.1964`. :cite:`Nesterov.2018` has a detailed theoretical discussion in the context of convex optimization. Momentum in deep learning has been known to be beneficial for a long time. See e.g., the discussion by :cite:`Sutskever.Martens.Dahl.ea.2013` for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Ill-conditioned Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better understanding of the geometric properties of the momentum method we revisit gradient descent, albeit with a significantly less pleasant objective function. Recall that in :numref:`sec_gd` we used $f(\\mathbf{x}) = x_1^2 + 2 x_2^2$, i.e., a moderately distorted ellipsoid objective. We distort this function further by stretching it out in the $x_1$ direction via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{x}) = 0.1 x_1^2 + 2 x_2^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As before $f$ has its minimum at $(0, 0)$. This function is *very* flat in the direction of $x_1$. Let us see what happens when we perform gradient descent as before on this new function. We pick a learning rate of $0.4$."

See the [Distill post](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) of :cite:`Goh.2017` for a great animation and :cite:`Flammarion.Bach.2015` for a detailed analysis. One can show that $0 < \\eta \\lambda < 2 + 2 \\beta$ momentum converges. This is a larger range of feasible parameters when compared to $0 < \\eta \\lambda < 2$ for gradient descent. It also suggests that in general large values of $\\beta$ are desirable.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Momentum replaces gradients with a leaky average over past gradients. This accelerates convergence significantly.\n",
    "* It is desirable for both noise-free gradient descent and (noisy) stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "* Momentum prevents stalling of the optimization process that is much more likely to occur for stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "* The effective number of gradients is given by $\\frac{1}{1-\\beta}$ due to exponentiated downweighting of past data.\n",
    "* In the case of convex quadratic problems this can be analyzed explicitly in detail.\n",
    "* Implementation is quite straightforward but it requires us to store an additional state vector (momentum $\\mathbf{v}$).\n",
