    "# Gradient Descent\n",
    ":label:`sec_gd`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we are going to introduce the basic concepts underlying gradient descent. This is brief by necessity. See e.g., :cite:`Boyd.Vandenberghe.2004` for an in-depth introduction to convex optimization. Although the latter is rarely used directly in deep learning, an understanding of gradient descent is key to understanding stochastic gradient descent algorithms. For instance, the optimization problem might diverge due to an overly large learning rate. This phenomenon can already be seen in gradient descent. Likewise, preconditioning is a common technique in gradient descent and carries over to more advanced algorithms. Let us start with a simple special case.\n",

    "## Gradient Descent in One Dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent in one dimension is an excellent example to explain why the gradient descent algorithm may reduce the value of the objective function. Consider some continuously differentiable real-valued function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Using a Taylor expansion (:numref:`sec_single_variable_calculus`) we obtain that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x + \\epsilon) = f(x) + \\epsilon f'(x) + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2).$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`gd-taylor`\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, in first approximation $f(x+\\epsilon)$ is given by the function value $f(x)$ and the first derivative $f'(x)$ at $x$. It is not unreasonable to assume that for small $\\epsilon$ moving in the direction of the negative gradient will decrease $f$. To keep things simple we pick a fixed step size $\\eta > 0$ and choose $\\epsilon = -\\eta f'(x)$. Plugging this into the Taylor expansion above we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x - \\eta f'(x)) = f(x) - \\eta f'^2(x) + \\mathcal{O}(\\eta^2 f'^2(x)).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the derivative $f'(x) \\neq 0$ does not vanish we make progress since $\\eta f'^2(x)>0$. Moreover, we can always choose $\\eta$ small enough for the higher order terms to become irrelevant. Hence we arrive at\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x - \\eta f'(x)) \\lessapprox f(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, if we use\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\leftarrow x - \\eta f'(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "to iterate $x$, the value of function $f(x)$ might decline. Therefore, in gradient descent we first choose an initial value $x$ and a constant $\\eta > 0$ and then use them to continuously iterate $x$ until the stop condition is reached, for example, when the magnitude of the gradient $|f'(x)|$ is small enough or the number of iterations has reached a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we choose the objective function $f(x)=x^2$ to illustrate how to implement gradient descent. Although we know that $x=0$ is the solution to minimize $f(x)$, we still use this simple function to observe how $x$ changes. As always, we begin by importing all required modules."

    "This went spectacularly wrong. How can we fix it? One way would be to \"fix\" the Hessian by taking its absolute value instead. Another strategy is to bring back the learning rate. This seems to defeat the purpose, but not quite. Having second order information allows us to be cautious whenever the curvature is large and to take longer steps whenever the objective is flat. Let us see how this works with a slightly smaller learning rate, say $\\eta = 0.5$. As we can see, we have quite an efficient algorithm."

    "### Convergence Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We only analyze the convergence rate for convex and three times differentiable $f$, where at its minimum $x^*$ the second derivative is nonzero, i.e., where $f''(x^*) > 0$. The multivariate proof is a straightforward extension of the argument below and omitted since it doesn't help us much in terms of intuition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Denote by $x_k$ the value of $x$ at the $k$-th iteration and let $e_k := x_k - x^*$ be the distance from optimality. By Taylor series expansion we have that the condition $f'(x^*) = 0$ can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = f'(x_k - e_k) = f'(x_k) - e_k f''(x_k) + \\frac{1}{2} e_k^2 f'''(\\xi_k).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This holds for some $\\xi_k \\in [x_k - e_k, x_k]$. Recall that we have the update $x_{k+1} = x_k - f'(x_k) / f''(x_k)$. Dividing the above expansion by $f''(x_k)$ yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e_k - f'(x_k) / f''(x_k) = \\frac{1}{2} e_k^2 f'''(\\xi_k) / f''(x_k).$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in the update equations leads to the following bound $e_{k+1} \\leq e_k^2 f'''(\\xi_k) / f'(x_k)$. Consequently, whenever we are in a region of bounded $f'''(\\xi_k) / f''(x_k) \\leq c$, we have a quadratically decreasing error $e_{k+1} \\leq c e_k^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, optimization researchers call this *linear* convergence, whereas a condition such as $e_{k+1} \\leq \\alpha e_k$ would be called a *constant* rate of convergence. \n",
    "Note that this analysis comes with a number of caveats: We do not really have much of a guarantee when we will reach the region of rapid convergence. Instead, we only know that once we reach it, convergence will be very quick. Second, this requires that $f$ is well-behaved up to higher order derivatives. It comes down to ensuring that $f$ does not have any \"surprising\" properties in terms of how it might change its values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Preconditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite unsurprisingly computing and storing the full Hessian is very expensive. It is thus desirable to find alternatives. One way to improve matters is by avoiding to compute the Hessian in its entirety but only compute the *diagonal* entries. While this is not quite as good as the full Newton method, it is still much better than not using it. Moreover, estimates for the main diagonal elements are what drives some of the innovation in stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms. This leads to update algorithms of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{x} - \\eta \\mathrm{diag}(H_f)^{-1} \\nabla \\mathbf{x}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this might be a good idea consider a situation where one variable denotes height in millimeters and the other one denotes height in kilometers. Assuming that for both the natural scale is in meters we have a terrible mismatch in parameterizations. Using preconditioning removes this. Effectively preconditioning with gradient descent amounts to selecting a different learning rate for each coordinate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent with Line Search\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key problems in gradient descent was that we might overshoot the goal or make insufficient progress. A simple fix for the problem is to use line search in conjunction with gradient descent. That is, we use the direction given by $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})$ and then perform binary search as to which step length $\\eta$ minimizes $f(\\mathbf{x} - \\eta \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}))$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm converges rapidly (for an analysis and proof see e.g., :cite:`Boyd.Vandenberghe.2004`). However, for the purpose of deep learning this is not quite so feasible, since each step of the line search would require us to evaluate the objective function on the entire dataset. This is way too costly to accomplish. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning rates matter. Too large and we diverge, too small and we do not make progress.\n",
    "* Gradient descent can get stuck in local minima.\n",
    "* In high dimensions adjusting learning the learning rate is complicated.\n",
    "* Preconditioning can help with scale adjustment.\n",
    "* Newton's method is a lot faster *once* it has started working properly in convex problems.\n",
    "* Beware of using Newton's method without any adjustments for nonconvex problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment with different learning rates and objective functions for gradient descent.\n",
    "1. Implement line search to minimize a convex function in the interval $[a, b]$.\n",
    "    * Do you need derivatives for binary search, i.e., to decide whether to pick $[a, (a+b)/2]$ or $[(a+b)/2, b]$. \n",
    "    * How rapid is the rate of convergence for the algorithm?\n",
    "    * Implement the algorithm and apply it to minimizing $\\log (\\exp(x) + \\exp(-2*x -3))$.\n",
    "1. Design an objective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ where gradient descent is exceedingly slow. Hint - scale different coordinates differently.\n",
    "1. Implement the lightweight version of Newton's method using preconditioning:\n",
    "    * Use diagonal Hessian as preconditioner.\n",
    "    * Use the absolute values of that rather than the actual (possibly signed) values. \n",
    "    * Apply this to the problem above.\n",
    "1. Apply the algorithm above to a number of objective functions (convex or not). What happens if you rotate coordinates by $45$ degrees?"
