There is a rich body of literature explaining how to arrive at the function $L(\\mathbf{x}, \\alpha)$. For our purposes it is sufficient to know that the saddlepoint of $L$ is where the original constrained optimization problem is solved optimally.\n", "\n", "### Penalties\n", "\n", "One way of satisfying constrained optimization problems at least approximately is to adapt the Lagrange function $L$.
