    "First, let us take a look at \n",
    "a simple strategy: *greedy search*.\n",
    "This strategy has been used to predict sequences in :numref:`sec_seq2seq`.\n",
    "In greedy search,\n",
    "at any time step $t'$ of the output sequence, \n",
    "we search for the token \n",
    "with the highest conditional probability from $\\mathcal{Y}$, i.e., \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{t'} = \\operatorname*{argmax}_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} P(y \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_{t'-1}, \\mathbf{c}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as the output. \n",
    "Once \"&lt;eos&gt;\" is outputted or the output sequence has reached its maximum length $T'$, the output sequence is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can go wrong with greedy search?\n",
    "In fact,\n",
    "the *optimal sequence*\n",
    "should be the output sequence\n",
    "with the maximum \n",
    "$\\prod_{t'=1}^{T'} P(y_{t'} \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_{t'-1}, \\mathbf{c})$,\n",
    "which is\n",
    "the conditional probability of generating an output sequence based on the input sequence.\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no guarantee\n",
    "that the optimal sequence will be obtained\n",
    "by greedy search.\n",
    "\n",
    "![At each time step, greedy search selects the token with the highest conditional probability.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/master/img/s2s-prob1.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_s2s-prob1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us illustrate it with an example.\n",
    "Suppose that there are four tokens \n",
    "\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"&lt;eos&gt;\" in the output dictionary.\n",
    "In :numref:`fig_s2s-prob1`,\n",
    "the four numbers under each time step represent the conditional probabilities of generating \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"&lt;eos&gt;\" at that time step, respectively.  \n",
    "At each time step, \n",
    "greedy search selects the token with the highest conditional probability. \n",
    "Therefore, the output sequence \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"&lt;eos&gt;\" will be predicted \n",
    "in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob1`. \n",
    "The conditional probability of this output sequence is $0.5\\times0.4\\times0.4\\times0.6 = 0.048$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The four numbers under each time step represent the conditional probabilities of generating \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"&lt;eos&gt;\" at that time step.  At time step 2, the token \"C\", which has the second highest conditional probability, is selected.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/master/img/s2s-prob2.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_s2s-prob2`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let us look at another example \n",
    "in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob2`. \n",
    "Unlike in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob1`, \n",
    "at time step 2\n",
    "we select the token \"C\"\n",
    "in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob2`, \n",

    "Since the output subsequences at time steps 1 and 2, \n",
    "on which time step 3 is based, \n",
    "have changed from \"A\" and \"B\" in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob1` to \"A\" and \"C\" in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob2`, \n",
    "the conditional probability of each token \n",
    "at time step 3 has also changed in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob2`. \n",
    "Suppose that we choose the token \"B\" at time step 3. \n",
    "Now time step 4 is conditional on\n",
    "the output subsequence at the first three time steps\n",
    "\"A\", \"C\", and \"B\", \n",
    "which is different from \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob1`. \n",
    "Therefore, the conditional probability of generating each token at time step 4 in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob2` is also different from that in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob1`. \n",
    "As a result, \n",
    "the conditional probability of the output sequence \"A\", \"C\", \"B\", and \"&lt;eos&gt;\" \n",
    "in :numref:`fig_s2s-prob2`\n",
    "is $0.5\\times0.3 \\times0.6\\times0.6=0.054$, \n",

    "In this example, \n",
    "the output sequence \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"&lt;eos&gt;\" obtained by the greedy search is not an optimal sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exhaustive Search\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal is to obtain the optimal sequence, we may consider using *exhaustive search*: \n",
    "exhaustively enumerate all the possible output sequences with their conditional probabilities,\n",
    "then output the one \n",
    "with the highest conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we can use exhaustive search to obtain the optimal sequence, \n",
    "its computational cost $\\mathcal{O}(\\left|\\mathcal{Y}\\right|^{T'})$ is likely to be excessively high. \n",
    "For example, when $|\\mathcal{Y}|=10000$ and $T'=10$, we will need to evaluate $10000^{10} = 10^{40}$ sequences. This is next to impossible!\n",
    "On the other hand,\n",
    "the computational cost of greedy search is \n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(\\left|\\mathcal{Y}\\right|T')$: \n",
    "it is usually significantly smaller than\n",
    "that of exhaustive search. For example, when $|\\mathcal{Y}|=10000$ and $T'=10$, we only need to evaluate $10000\\times10=10^5$ sequences.\n",
